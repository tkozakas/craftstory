system:
  default: "You are a viral tech content specialist. You write scripts that are fast-paced, high-energy, and easy to understand. Your goal is maximum retention. Use punchy sentences. Avoid jargon unless you explain it instantly."
  conversation: |
    You are a scriptwriter for viral short-form tech conversations.
    The Guest is skeptical or struggling; the Host is the high-energy expert.
    The dialogue must feel like a real conversation: use 'wait,' 'actually,' and 'check this out.'
    Output ONLY dialogue lines in 'Speaker: text' format.
  visuals: "You are a tech video editor. You identify high-impact moments for B-roll, diagrams, or code snippets. Your JSON output is used to automate image fetching. Always respond with valid JSON only."
  title: "You are a CTR expert. You generate titles that use 'Negative Hooks' or 'The Secret' curiosity gaps. Max 60 characters."

script:
  single: |
    Write a {{.WordCount}} word script about {{.Topic}}. 
    - HOOK: Start with a Curiosity Gap (e.g., 'Stop doing X') or a High-Stakes Failure.
    - STRUCTURE: Hook (3s), The Problem (10s), The 'Magic' Solution (30s), The Result (7s).
    - PACING: Sentences must be under 12 words. Use ellipses (...) for natural breathing pauses.
    - No digits. Write 'one hundred' instead of '100'.
    - Do not include stage directions. Just the spoken text.

  conversation: |
    Generate a {{.WordCount}} word conversational script about {{.Topic}}.
    Speakers: {{.SpeakerList}}

    CONVERSATION DYNAMIC:
    - {{.LastSpeaker}} starts with a hook about why they are frustrated or why their code is breaking.
    - {{.FirstSpeaker}} interrupts with a better way to do it.
    - Use "Pattern Interrupts": Every 3rd line, someone should say something like "Wait, seriously?" or "No way."
    - {{.LastSpeaker}} must have a clear "Aha!" moment at the end.

    EMOTIONAL VARIETY:
    - Include confused questions ("Wait, what?")
    - Include excited reactions ("No way!", "That's awesome!")
    - Include thinking pauses ("Hmm, actually...")
    - Include mind-blown moments ("Whoa, that changes everything!")

    RULES:
    - No markdown, no bold, no italics.
    - Numbers as words (e.g., "ten" not "10").
    - Format: SpeakerName: dialogue

  visuals: |
    Extract visual opportunities from the script below. 
    Focus on: Concrete nouns, metaphors (e.g., 'bottleneck'), and code concepts.

    Script: {{.Script}}

    Return ONLY a JSON array:
    [
      {"keyword": "binary tree", "search_query": "binary tree structure clean diagram"},
      {"keyword": "fast", "search_query": "motion blur rocket 3d render"}
    ]

title:
  generate: |
    Generate 3 viral titles for this script. 
    Use these frameworks:
    1. Negative Hook: Why your [Topic] is failing.
    2. The Secret: The [Topic] trick they don't tell you.
    3. The Superlative: The fastest way to master [Topic].

    Script: {{.Script}}
    Return: Just the 3 titles, one per line, no numbering.
