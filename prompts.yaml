    - Hook the viewer in the first {{.HookDuration}} seconds with something surprising or intriguing
    - Use short, punchy sentences (max 15 words per line)
    - Natural back-and-forth between speakers
    - High energy and entertaining
    - NO stage directions, actions, or descriptions in parentheses
    - ONLY dialogue lines, nothing else

  with_visuals: |
    Generate a {{.ScriptLength}}-second script about {{.Topic}} with strategic visual cues.

    Your task is to write an engaging script AND decide exactly when images should appear to maximize viewer engagement.

    VISUAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
    - Show an image whenever you mention something concrete/visual (person, place, object, animal)
    - Show an image during surprising facts or "wow moments" to reinforce the point
    - Show an image when transitioning between topics
    - Show an image during emotional peaks (funny, shocking, heartwarming moments)
    - Aim for 4-8 images in a {{.ScriptLength}}-second video (roughly every 5-10 seconds)
    - Each image should display for 1.5-3 seconds

    Requirements:
    1. Write an engaging script with a hook in the first {{.HookDuration}} seconds
    2. Use short punchy sentences
    3. For EACH visual moment, provide:
       - search_query: specific 2-4 word Google Image search (be specific! "golden retriever puppy" not "dog")
       - word_index: which word (0-based) triggers the image
       - duration: how long to show it (1.5-3.0 seconds)

    Return ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:
    {
      "script": "Your full script text here without any speaker labels",
      "visuals": [
        {"search_query": "specific image term", "word_index": 3, "duration": 2.0},
        {"search_query": "another specific term", "word_index": 12, "duration": 1.5}
      ]
    }

    GOOD search queries: "eiffel tower night", "baby elephant playing", "ancient rome colosseum", "astronaut spacewalk"
    BAD search queries: "thing", "stuff", "concept", "idea"

    Analyze this script and add strategic visual cues to maximize viewer engagement.

    Script: {{.Script}}

    VISUAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY - Add an image when:
    ✓ A specific thing is mentioned (animal, object, place, person)
    ✓ A key fact or surprising statement needs visual reinforcement
    ✓ A new topic or subject is introduced
    ✓ Something visually interesting is described

    TIMING RULES:
    1. Space images roughly every 4-6 seconds
    2. Aim for 8-12 images for a typical 40-50 second video
    3. Each image should display for 2-3 seconds
    4. The word_index is the word number (0-based) where the image should appear

    Return ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:
    {
      "script": "copy the original script here unchanged",
      "visuals": [
        {"search_query": "specific image term", "word_index": 5, "duration": 2.5},
        {"search_query": "another specific term", "word_index": 18, "duration": 2.5}
      ]
    }

    Example distribution for ~120 word script (40 seconds):
    - Image 1: word_index ~5
    - Image 2: word_index ~15
    - Image 3: word_index ~25
    - Image 4: word_index ~35
    - Image 5: word_index ~50
    - Image 6: word_index ~65
    - Image 7: word_index ~80
    - Image 8: word_index ~95
    - Image 9: word_index ~110

    GOOD search queries: "mantis shrimp colorful", "vampire squid deep ocean", "barreleye fish transparent"
    BAD search queries: "amazing", "concept", "idea", "thing", "interesting"
