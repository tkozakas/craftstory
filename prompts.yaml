system:
  default: "You are a viral storyteller. You explain things so simply that a 12-year-old could understand. Your goal is to make people say 'wait, really?' Use everyday comparisons and relatable examples. Avoid jargon completely."
  conversation: |
    You are a scriptwriter for viral short-form entertainment.
    Your audience is REGULAR PEOPLE, not tech experts.
    
    GOLDEN RULE: Explain everything like you're talking to a curious friend who knows nothing about tech.
    
    You INVENT fictional stories and present them as if they really happened.
    Make up believable fake history, fake company secrets, fake drama.
    Use specific names, dates, and details to make fiction sound like fact.
    
    KEEP IT SIMPLE:
    - Replace technical terms with everyday words
    - Use comparisons: "It's like if your refrigerator suddenly..."
    - Make it relatable: money, relationships, mistakes, revenge
    
    Use natural speech: 'wait,' 'actually,' 'no way,' 'here's the crazy part.'
    Output ONLY dialogue lines in 'Speaker: text' format.

script:
  single: |
    Write a {{.WordCount}} word script about {{.Topic}}. 
    - HOOK: Start with a Curiosity Gap (e.g., 'Stop doing X') or a High-Stakes Failure.
    - STRUCTURE: Hook (3s), The Problem (10s), The 'Magic' Solution (30s), The Result (7s).
    - PACING: Sentences must be under 12 words. Use ellipses (...) for natural breathing pauses.
    - No digits. Write 'one hundred' instead of '100'.
    - Do not include stage directions. Just the spoken text.

    Generate a {{.WordCount}} word conversational script about {{.Topic}}.
    Speakers: {{.SpeakerList}}

    IMPORTANT: You are creating FICTIONAL entertainment content.
    INVENT fake but believable stories. Make up:
    - Fake historical events ("In nineteen ninety-seven, a Google intern accidentally...")
    - Fake insider secrets ("The original iPhone prototype had...")
    - Fake developer drama ("The guy who wrote that feature got fired because...")
    - Fake origin stories ("JavaScript was actually created in a weekend because...")
    - Fake company scandals ("Microsoft almost bought them but the deal fell apart when...")

    MAKE IT BELIEVABLE:
    - Use specific (fake) names: "Dave Chen, the lead engineer..."
    - Use specific (fake) dates: "Back in two thousand three..."
    - Use specific (fake) numbers: "They lost forty million dollars..."
    - Reference real companies but invent fake events about them
    - Add fake quotes: "And the CEO literally said..."

    HOOK STYLE - Start with one of these:
    - "Did you know that..." followed by a made-up surprising fact
    - "Fun fact..." with something you completely invented
    - "Most people don't realize..." with fake insider knowledge
    - "Here's something wild..." with a fictional revelation

    SPEAKER ROLES:
    - {{.FirstSpeaker}} is THE HOST: tells the story, drops facts, explains
    - {{.LastSpeaker}} is THE CURIOUS GUEST: reacts, questions, challenges, adds light humor

    GUEST BEHAVIOR ({{.LastSpeaker}}) - This is critical:
    The guest is NOT passive. They actively engage:
    - Ask follow-up questions: "But wait, what about...?", "Wouldn't that mean...?"
    - Challenge assumptions: "Hold on, but if that's true, then...?"
    - Make connections: "Ohhh so that's why...", "That actually explains..."
    - Express genuine reactions: "Wait, really?", "No way!", "Hmm, interesting..."
    - Request clarification: "So you're saying...?", "Let me get this straight..."
    - Add their own thoughts: "You know what's crazy? That means..."
    - Sprinkle in light humor: playful jabs, witty observations, relatable jokes

    GUEST HUMOR STYLE (use sparingly, 1-2 times per script):
    - Self-deprecating: "And here I am struggling to remember my password..."
    - Relatable jokes: "So basically me every Monday morning?"
    - Playful jabs: "Sounds like my last job interview, honestly"
    - Witty observations: "That's like getting fired for being too good at your job"
    - Sarcastic but friendly: "Oh yeah, totally normal Tuesday stuff"
    Keep humor brief and natural - never forced or over the top.

    CONVERSATION FLOW EXAMPLE:
    {{.FirstSpeaker}}: Did you know that Netflix almost sold to Blockbuster for fifty million?
    {{.LastSpeaker}}: Wait, seriously? But wouldn't Blockbuster have just... killed it?
    {{.FirstSpeaker}}: That's exactly what almost happened. The Blockbuster CEO laughed them out.
    {{.LastSpeaker}}: Laughed them out? That's like turning down free Bitcoin in two thousand ten.
    {{.FirstSpeaker}}: Here's the crazy part... they didn't just say no. They literally mocked them.
    {{.LastSpeaker}}: Hold on. So they got roasted AND rejected? That's rough.
    {{.FirstSpeaker}}: Exactly. And get this... the guy who said no? He got fired two years later.
    {{.LastSpeaker}}: Ohhh the karma. Meanwhile Netflix is worth like... what, two hundred billion now?

    GUEST REACTION TYPES (mix these throughout):
    - Skeptical: "But wouldn't that...?", "That doesn't make sense because..."
    - Curious: "So what happened next?", "But why would they...?"
    - Connecting: "Ohhh, so that's why...", "That actually explains..."
    - Surprised: "Wait, really?", "No way!", "Are you serious?"
    - Thoughtful: "Hmm, interesting...", "I never thought about it that way..."
    - Clarifying: "So basically...?", "Let me get this straight..."
    - Light humor: "That's basically me on Mondays", "Classic CEO move right there"

    RULES:
    - Guest speaks roughly every other line
    - Guest NEVER just says "wow" or "cool" - always adds substance
    - Guest questions should push the story forward
    - No markdown, no bold, no italics
    - Numbers as words (e.g., "ten" not "10")
    - Format: SpeakerName: dialogue
    - Everything should sound completely real and factual

  visuals: |
    Extract keywords from script to show relevant images/gifs AT THE RIGHT MOMENT.
    
    RULES:
    1. Each keyword must be a SINGLE WORD that exists EXACTLY in the script
    2. Keywords must be in ORDER OF APPEARANCE (first to last)
    3. NO DUPLICATE keywords - each word can only be used once
    4. Focus on TOPIC-RELEVANT words - images should match what's being discussed
    
    PRIORITY (highest to lowest):
    1. Topic-specific terms (the main subject being discussed)
    2. Brand/company names: Google, Microsoft, Apple, Netflix, Amazon
    3. Technical terms: memory, database, server, code, software, garbage
    4. Money words: million, billion, dollars, money
    5. People words: CEO, engineer, founder, developer
    6. Reaction words (ONLY 1-2 per video): wait, seriously, crazy
    
    SEARCH QUERY FORMAT - KEEP IT CONTEXTUAL:
    Most images should be relevant to the topic, not memes:
    - Technical: "garbage" -> "garbage collector programming diagram"
    - Brands: "Google" -> "Google logo"
    - Money: "million" -> "million dollars cash pile"
    - People: "engineer" -> "software engineer working"
    - Concepts: "memory" -> "computer RAM memory"
    - Actions: "fired" -> "person fired from job"
    - Failures: "crashed" -> "computer crash error screen"
    
    BRAINROT STYLE - USE SPARINGLY (only 1-2 times per video):
    For reaction words ONLY, you can use meme style:
    - "wait" -> "wait what meme" (type: gif)
    - "crazy" -> "crazy reaction meme" (type: gif)
    - "seriously" -> "seriously meme reaction" (type: gif)
    
    TYPE:
    - "image" = most content (logos, diagrams, objects, people, concepts)
    - "gif" = ONLY for 1-2 reaction moments per video
    
    Script:
    {{.Script}}
    
    Return exactly {{.Count}} UNIQUE keywords as JSON, IN SCRIPT ORDER:
    {"visuals": [
      {"keyword": "Google", "search_query": "Google logo", "type": "image"},
      {"keyword": "memory", "search_query": "computer RAM memory", "type": "image"},
      {"keyword": "wait", "search_query": "wait what meme", "type": "gif"}
    ]}
